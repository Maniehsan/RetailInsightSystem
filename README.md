# Retail Insight Analytical System

## Project Overview
Retail Insight Analytical System is a Python-based data analytics project designed to analyze retail product data and provide valuable insights. This project uses machine learning techniques such as decision trees, K-means clustering, and association rule mining to uncover patterns and trends in product sales.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Product trend analysis using decision trees
- Customer segmentation through K-means clustering
- Market basket analysis with association rules (Apriori algorithm)
- Visualization of key insights

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn (for data handling and visualization)
- scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
- mlxtend (for association rule mining)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maniehsan/RetailInsightSystem.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RetailInsightSystem
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the main analysis script:
   ```bash
   python retail_insight.py
   ```
## What I Learned
